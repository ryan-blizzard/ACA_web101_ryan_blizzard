        <div><h1>THE STORY OF RYAN BLIZZARD</h1>
          <div><p> I'm a Web Developing student at Austin's finest Austin Coding Academy.  Before making the jump into the developing world you could have found me playing in the dirt.  Racing motocross became part of my life at 5 years old and continued for 20 plus years.  10 of those years were spent racing professionally, traveling/living all of the world and country.  After deciding to call it a career, I then found myself in the hard search for what was next.  A couple years and couple labor filled jobs later, I find myself in the tech world of Web Developing.  Learning this new world is a fun, fast paced, and forever changing world Iâ€™m very much enjoying.  With the years of hard work, training, and the dedication my past career racing took is the kind of effort and work ethic I look to put into learning this new career. </p>
